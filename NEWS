ggpmisc 0.2.8
=============

Add stat_fit_deviations() for easily highlighting residuals in plots of fitted
models, and stat_fit_residuals() for easily plotting residuals in plots matching
plots of lm fits plotted with stat_smooth() even with grouping or facets. They
support lm() fits.

Add stat_fit_glance() and stat_fit_augment() for maximum flexibility at the
expense of always having to set aesthetics.

ggpmisc 0.2.7
=============

Add support for AIC and BIC labels to stat_poly_eq().
Add pretty-printing of parameter values expressed in engineering notation in
stat_poly_eq().
Add support for user-supplied label coordinates in stat_poly_eq().
Improve stat_debug_panel() and stat_debug_group() so that they can optionally
print to the console a summary of the data received as input.
Add geom_debug(), a geom that summarizes its data input to the console, and
produces no visible graphical output.

ggpmisc 0.2.6
=============

Add support for user-supplied lhs and for user-supplied rhs-variable name in
the equation label in stat_poly_eq().

ggpmisc 0.2.5
=============

Remove one example to remove a package dependency.

ggpmisc 0.2.4
=============

Improve handling of time zones in try_data_frame().
Revise documentation and vignette.

ggpmisc 0.2.3
=============

stat_poly_eq() changed to include the lhs (left hand side) of the equation by
default.

ggpmisc 0.2.2
=============

Add function try_data_frame() to convert R objects including time series
objects of all classes accepted by try.xts() into data frames suitable for
plotting with ggplot().

Update stat_peaks() and stat_valleys() to work correctly when the x aesthetic
uses a Date or Datetime continuous scale such as ggplot() sets automatically
for POSIXct variables mapped to the x aesthetic.

ggpmisc 0.2.1
=============

Rename stat_debug() as stat_debug_group() and add stat_debug_panel().
Add stat_peaks() and stat_valleys() (these are simpler versions of
ggspectra::stat_peaks() and ggspectra::stat_valleys() for use with any
numerical data (rather than light spectra).

ggpmisc 0.1.0
=============

First version.
Add stat_poly_eq()
Add stat_debug()
