[![](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/ggpmisc)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggpmisc) 

Package '**ggpmisc**' (Miscellaneous Extensions to 'ggplot2') is a set of
extensions to R package 'ggplot2' (>= 3.0.0) with emphasis on annotations and
highlighting related to fitted models and data summaries. To complement these,
the widely useful `geom_table()` and `stat_fmt_tb()` are defined as well as
`ggplot` constructors for time series objects. The provided `ggplot.ts()` and
`ggplot.xts()` use `try_tibble()` which is also exported and accepts objects of
additional classes as input.

Statistics useful for highlighting and/or annotating individual data points 
in regions of plot panels with high/low densities of observations. These stats are designed to work
well together with `geom_text_repel()` and `geom_label_repel()` from package 
'ggrepel'.

**Note:** Functions for the manipulation of layers in ggplot objects and statistics and
geometries that echo their data input to the R console, earlier included in this
package are now in package 'gginnards'.

## Examples

```{r readme-02, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpmisc)
```

In the first example we plot a time series using the specialized version of
`ggplot()` that converts the time series into a tibble and maps the `x`
and `y` aesthetics automatically. We also highlight and label the peaks
using `stat_peaks`.

```{r readme-03}
ggplot(lynx, as.numeric = FALSE) + geom_line() + 
  stat_peaks(colour = "red") +
  stat_peaks(geom = "text", colour = "red", angle = 66,
             hjust = -0.1, x.label.fmt = "%Y") +
  expand_limits(y = 8000)
```

In the second example we add the equation for a fitted polynomial plus the
adjusted coefficient of determination to a plot showing the observations plus
the fitted curve and confidence band. We use `stat_poly_eq()`.

```{r readme-04}
formula <- y ~ x + I(x^2)
ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = formula) +
  stat_poly_eq(aes(label =  paste(..eq.label.., ..adj.rr.label.., sep = "~~~~")),
               formula = formula, parse = TRUE)
```

The same figure as in the second example but this time annotated with the
ANOVA table for the model fit. We use `stat_fit_tb()` which can be used to add
ANOVA or summary tables.

```{r readme-05}
formula <- y ~ x + I(x^2)
ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = formula) +
  stat_fit_tb(method = "lm",
              method.args = list(formula = formula),
              tb.type = "fit.anova",
              tb.vars = c(Effect = "term", 
                          "df",
                          "M.S." = "meansq", 
                          "italic(F)" = "statistic", 
                          "italic(P)" = "p.value"),
               label.y.npc = "top", label.x.npc = "left",
              parse = TRUE)
```
